Coursera's Getting & Cleaning Data Project
=====================================
https://www.coursera.org/course/getdata

>The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. You will be graded by your peers on a series of yes/no questions related to the project. You will be required to submit: 1) a tidy data set as described below, 2) a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis, and 3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.  


## How the script works:

>* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set;
>* Extracts to a new data set only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement;
>* Changes the numbers in the activity_label column to the corresponding names of the activity from activity_labels.txt; 
>* Change the names of the columns to descriptive variable names. 
>* Creates a second, independent tidy data set named tidyData.txt with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
